  <h1>This is Day 2 and 3 of HTML (11/30/21 & 12/1/21) </h1>
  <br>
  <h4>For some reason, my notes for this section was lost on code.io so I will just have to do a summary.
    <br>
    I learned how to do ordered and unordered lists as well as the <em>"empasis tag"</em> and the <strong>"Strong tag"</strong> 
    instead of the <i>"Italics tag"</i> and the <b>"Bold tag"</b>.
    </b>
    Then I learned how to as a image to my webpage by using the Boilerplate "img:srcset" like so:
    <br>
    <img src="Images/U-Bae Single Cover small.jpeg" alt="Chyka's singe U-Bae Single Cover" srcset="">
    <br>
    I can add a picture path like above or use a Http webpage where the image is.

  <h1>This is Day 4 of HTML (12/3/2021)</h1>
